# Purpose
Chef Cookbook that will setup the basics for various flavors of Linux and Windows Servers.
Be sure to set appropriate overrides for what you do and don't want to be setup in your environment files.
This is a great starting point for all your nodes. It's also a great example for writing wrapper cookbooks.

The secondary purpose of this cookbook is to give various examples that can be replicated in other cookbooks. I did my best to include all the major coding and testing scenarios.

# Supported Platforms
At least temporarily I've focused only ona Amazon Linux. I have not tested all the other flavors since v2.0.0 release.
I plan to work through the other distros over time.
* Linux
    * Amazon (EC2 Only)
    * RHEL 6/7 (EC2 Only) **Not Fully Tested**
    * CentOS 6/7 **Not Fully Tested**
    * Ubuntu 14/16 **Not Fully Tested**
* Windows (EC2 Only - WIP) **May Never Get Around to Winderz**
    * 2012 R2
    * 2016

# Successfully Tested Versions
| Driver | Version |
| :--- | :--- |
| Mac OSX | 10.12.3 |
| Docker | 17.03.1-ce, build c6d412e |
| Chef Development Kit | 1.2.22 |
| Chef-client | 12.18.31 |

# Features
All operations have attributes to disable/enable them. Here's what is out of the box.

### Defaults (Item )
* Create Docker or AWS EC2 Instance
* Install basic packages.
    * I put a few basic packages I like, but you can override the array.   
* Install CloudWatch Logs Agent
* Create Basic CloudWatch Logs Config
    * Disable if going to deploy your own from your wrapper
* Create **nodeinfo** shell script to output system info
* Disable SeLinux
* Add /usr/local/bin to sudo secure path in sudoers for Amazon Linux
* Setup Yum Cron automatic security patches on Amazon Linux

### Optionals    
* Proxy Setup
* Gem Source Change
* EPEL Repo setup
* Install EPEL Packages
* Deploy Internal CA Certificate from Data Bag Item

# JSON Chef Config Files
There are Chef environments, roles and data bag items JSON files under the test folder.
These are called by the Test Kitchen configurations instead of entering all the attribute overrides inside the YAML.
It cleans up the kitchen YAML, plus makes it easier to quickly understand how you'd setup these Chef configurations in your environment.
Basically copy/paste, instead of converting YAML to JSON... I've done it for you!

```
test
├── data_bags
│   ├── encrypted_data_bag_secret
│   └── bonusbits_base
│       ├── credentials.json
│       └── enterprise_ca.json
├── environments
│   └── bonusbits_base.json
└── roles
    └── base.json
```

The data bag items are just examples. They are not currently used in the cookbook.
I added it mainly for when I copy/paste to write a new wrapper it's already staged for me.
I usually end up adding the customers CA cert chain as part of my base cookbook.
[Here's](https://www.bonusbits.com/wiki/HowTo:Add_Internal_Root_CA_to_CentOS_and_Chef_Client) some information on how to accomplish that task.

#Kitchen Configurations
The default Kitchen configuration ```.kitchen.yml``` is setup with AWS EC2 and Dokken Docker Drivers.

If using Kitchen simple specify the test suite with the driver you'd like to use. Both driver gems are included with ChefDK. 
The only prerequisites are having Docker installed and/or AWS Environment Variables setup. 
Unless you are using a public subnet in AWS then you'll want a direct connect or VPN solution in place.

### Command Examples
The kitchen commands need to be ran from the root directory of the cookbook.

| Task | Driver | Command |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| List All Test Suites | EC2 | ```kitchen list``` |
| List All Test Suites | Docker | ```KITCHEN_YAML=.kitchen.dokken.yml kitchen list``` |
| Run Chef on a Single Test Suite | EC2 | ```kitchen converge base-amazon```| 
| Run Integration Tests with ServerSpec on a Single Test Suite | Docker | ```KITCHEN_YAML=.kitchen.docker.yml kitchen verify base-centos-511``` |
| Test all Test Suites (destroy, create, converge, setup, verify and destroy) | EC2 | ```kitchen test``` | 
| Test all Test Suites (destroy, create, converge, setup, verify and destroy) | Docker | ```KITCHEN_YAML=.kitchen.docker.yml kitchen test``` | 
| Login to a Single Test Suite That is Already Created | EC2 | ```kitchen login base-amazon``` |
| Login to a Single Test Suite That is Already Created | Docker | ```KITCHEN_YAML=.kitchen.docker.yml kitchen login base-amazon``` |
| Create and Verify a Windows 2012 R2 EC2 Instance | EC2 | ```kitchen verify base-windows-2012r2```| 

# EC2 Requirements
1. Direct Connect, VPN or public subnet
    * A direct connect or VPN solution must be in place from you to the AWS VPC where you plan to stand up EC2 instances.
2. NAT or IGW 
    * The subnet that you plan to stand up the EC2 instances may require internet access to pull from Github etc.
3. AWS Credentials Profile Configured
    * Be sure to setup your AWS CLI profile even if you only have one. It's a more secure method to pass credentials to Test Kitchen.
    ```bash
    aws configure
    vim ~/.aws/config
    vim ~/.aws/credentials
    ```
4. Environment Variables
    * Set these Environment Variables or use .kitchen.local.yml config to overwrite the values with static personal information.
    ```
    AWS Environment Variables
    -----------------------------------------
    AWS_SSH_KEY_ID = {aws ssh key name}
    AWS_SSH_KEY_PATH = {/path/to/sshkey.pem}
    AWS_PROFILE = {aws config profile name}
    AWS_REGION = {us-west-2 or us-east-1}
    AWS_VPC_ID = {VPC ID to deploy}
    AWS_SUBNET = {subnet ID to deploy}
    AWS_PUBLIC_IP = {true or false}
    AWS_SECURITY_GROUP_1 = {security group ID}
    AWS_IAM_INSTANCE_PROFILE_1 = {EC2 Instance IAM Profile Role Name}
    ```
    
    Setup to support up to 5 security groups. More IAM Profiles staged for multiple instance role support.

# NodeInfo Script
You can run the nodeinfo script locally or use Test Kitchen to run it. You can have it run on one, multiple or all of the test suite VMs you have running.
Below are some examples:

# Network Proxy
I have stubbed out proxy support in the kitchen configuration yaml files and a temp workaround for local "Virtualbox" VMs.
Usually you don't have to deal with a proxy issue in AWS. The defaults I have assume you are using [Charles Proxy](https://www.bonusbits.com/wiki/HowTo:Configure_Test_Kitchen_to_Use_Charles_Proxy), but you can override the attributes and change the kitchen configs to your own settings.
Keep in mind if you are not using Charles Proxy and pointing your BASH/PowerShell to it, you'll need to configure them as well.

## Enable Proxy in Kitchen Config (Deprecated)
Finally Test Kitchen will use your shell environment variables automatically!
